@article{Diao2002MIMO,
	Abstract = { Policy-based management provides a means for IT systems to operate according to business needs. Unfortunately, there is often an "impedance mismatch" between the policies administrators want and the controls they are given. Consider the Apache Web server. Administrators want to control CPU and memory utilizations, but this must be done indirectly by manipulating tuning parameters such as MaxClients and KeepAlive. There has been much interest in using feedback control to bridge the impedance mismatch. However, these efforts have focused on a single metric that is manipulated by a single control and hence have not considered interactions between controls such as those that are common in computing systems. This paper shows how multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) control theory can be used to enforce policies for interrelated metrics. MIMO is used both to model the target system, Apache in our case, and to design feedback controllers. The MIMO model captures the interactions between KA and MC, and can be used to identify infeasible metric policies. In addition, MIMO control techniques can provide considerable benefit in handling trade-offs between speed of metric convergence and sensitivity to random fluctuations while enforcing the desired policies.},

	Abstract = {Internet traffic is bursty and network servers are often overloaded with surprising events or abnormal client request patterns.  This paper studies scheduling algorithms for interactive network services that use multiple threads to handle incoming requests continuously and concurrently.  Our investigation with applications from Ask Jeeves search shows that during overloaded situations, requests that require excessive computing resource can dramatically affect the overall system throughput and response time.  The most effective method is to manage resource usage at a request level instead of a thread or process level.  We propose a new size-adaptive request-aware scheduling algorithm called SRQ with dynamic feedbacks to control queue properties and have implemented SRQ in the Linux kernel level.  Our experimental results with several application service benchmarks indicate that the proposed scheduler can significantly outperform the standard Linux scheduler.},

	Abstract = {Event-based programming has been highly touted in recent years as
	the best way to write highly concurrent applications. Having worked
	on several of these systems, we now believe this approach to be
	a mistake. Specifically, we believe that threads can achieve all
	of the strengths of events, including support for high concurrency,
	low overhead, and a simple concurrency model. Moreover, we argue
	that threads allow a simpler and more natural programming style.


	We examine the claimed strengths of events over threads and show that
	the weaknesses of threads are artifacts of specific threading implementations
	and not inherent to the threading paradigm. As evidence, we present
	a user-level thread package that scales to 100,000 threads and achieves
	excellent performance in a web server. We also refine the duality
	argument of Lauer-Needham, which implies that good implementations
	of thread systems and event systems will have similar performance.
	Finally, we argue that compiler support for thread systems is a
	fruitful area for future research. It is a mistake to attempt high
	concurrency without help from the compiler, and we discuss several
	enhancements that are enabled by relatively simple compiler changes.},

	systems, we believe that threadbased systems can provide a simpler

	By implementing Capriccio as a user-level thread package, we have
	decoupled the thread package implementation from the underlying
	operating system. As a result, we can take advantage of cooperative
	threading, new asynchronous I/O mechanisms, and compiler support.
	Using this approach,

	we are able to provide three key features: (1) scalability to 100,000
	threads, (2) efficient stack management, and (3) resource-aware
	scheduling.


	We introduce linked stack management, which minimizes the amount of
	wasted stack space by providing safe, small, and non-contiguous
	stacks that can grow or shrink at run time. A compiler analysis
	makes our stack implementation efficient and sound. We also present
	resource-aware scheduling,

	which allows thread scheduling and admission control to adapt to the
	systems current resource usage. This technique uses a blocking
	graph that is automatically derived from the application to describe
	the flow of control between blocking points in a cooperative thread
	package. We have applied our techniques to the Apache 2.0.44 web

	In this paper, it is demonstrated that these two categories are duals

@techreport{Lee06ThreadProblems,
	Abstract = {Threads are a seemingly straightforward adaptation of the dominant
	sequential model of computation to concurrent systems. Languages
	require little or no syntactic changes to support threads, and operating
	systems and architectures have evolved to efficiently support them.
	Many technologists are pushing for increased use of multithreading
	in software in order to take advantage of the predicted increases
	in parallelism in computer architectures. In this paper, I argue
	that this is not a good idea. Although threads seem to be a small
	step from sequential computation, in fact, they represent a huge
	step. They discard the most essential and appealing properties of
	sequential computation: understandability, predictability, and determinism.
	Threads, as a model of computation, are wildly nondeterministic,
	and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism.
	Although many research techniques improve the model by offering
	more effective pruning, I argue that this is approaching the problem
	backwards. Rather than pruning nondeterminism, we should build from
	essentially deterministic, composable components. Nondeterminism
	should be explicitly and judiciously introduced where needed, rather
	than removed where not needed. The consequences of this principle
	are profound. I argue for the development of concurrent coordination
