%Despite this, Internet services often fail, particularly during periods of high demand. The complexity and cost involved in creating scalable, load tolerant, fault tolerant services on popular platforms is prohibitive.

%``Rapid tuning'' is one feature that is not addressed by existing platforms. Performance tuning is a time consuming task that requires extensive knowledge about the service and underlying platform. Minor alterations can dramatically change the performance characteristics of a service. As new features typically take precedence over performance tuning, many systems are poorly tuned. It is only after a significant performance or robustness issue is identified that systems are re--tuned. In the meantime, the poor performance may have already incurred a significant cost.
